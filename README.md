# Hord

Hord is a REST & gRPC interface for any Key-Value datastore. Our mission is to 
make managing data as simple as calling an API. 

Designed to be a simple to use Key-Value service. Hord gives applications a 
consistent method of accessing many database backends. Allowing users to 
leverage different databases with a simple URI change.

Hord is also here to manage the complexities of interacting with databases. 

* Cluster Failover
* Integration with Dynamic Credential backends
* Transparent Data Encryption
* and more...
