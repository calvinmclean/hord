Hord is a package that provides a generic interface abstraction over many
key-value datastores. The goal of Hord is to give applications a consistent
interface for many database/cache backends. Allowing users to switch the 
underlying datastore service with a simple import change.

Hord is here to manage the complexities of interacting with databases.
